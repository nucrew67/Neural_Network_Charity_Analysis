     Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
        An exercise in Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models using TensorFlow and Pandas libraries in Python to preprocess datasets and create a predictive binary classifier.
        The purpose of this analysis was to explore and implement neural networks using TensorFlow in Python. Neural networks is an advanced form of Machine Learning that can recognize patterns and features in the dataset. Neural networks are modeled after the human brain and contain layers of neurons that can perform individual computations. 
        Throughout this module, we learned:How to build a basic neural network:
Preprocess/prepare the datasets
Create a training and testing set
Measure model accuracy
Add additional neurons and hidden layers to optimize the model
Select the best model to use for our dataset

     Results:
        -There is a bulleted list that answers all six questions (15 pt)

     Summary:
        -There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
        -There is a recommendation on using a different model to solve the classification problem, and justification (3 pt)
