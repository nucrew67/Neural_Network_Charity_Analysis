     Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:
        An exercise in Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models using TensorFlow and Pandas libraries in Python to preprocess datasets and create a predictive binary classifier.
        The purpose of this analysis was to explore and implement neural networks using TensorFlow in Python. Neural networks is an advanced form of Machine Learning that can recognize patterns and features in the dataset. Neural networks are modeled after the human brain and contain layers of neurons that can perform individual computations. A great example of a Deep Learning Neural Network would be image recognition. The neural network will compute, connect, weigh and return an encoded categorical result to identify if the image represents a "dog" or a "cat" or as shown in the image below, George Washington.
        Throughout this module, we learned:

*How to build a basic neural network
*Preprocess/prepare the datasets
-Create a training and testing set
-Measure model accuracy
-Add additional neurons and hidden layers to optimize the model
-Select the best model to use for our dataset
AlphabetSoup, a philanthropic foundation is requesting for a mathematical, data-driven solution that will help determine which organizations are worth donating to and which ones are considered "high-risk". In the past, not every donation AlphabetSoup has made has been impactful as there have been applicants that will receive funding and then disappear. Beks, a data scientist for AlphabetSoup is tasked with analyzing the impact of each donation and vet the recipients to determine if the company's money will be used effectively. In order to accomplish this request, we are tasked with helping Beks create a binary classifier that will predict whether an organization will be successful with their funding. We utilize Deep Learning Neural Networks to evaluate the input data and produce clear decision making results.
